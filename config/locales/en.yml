# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      "RubyKaigi Schedule.select" is RubyKaigi's first official schedule creation and sharing app. You can list the sessions you are interested in and create your own viewing schedule!
      If you have ever wondered, "Which session should I watch…" before attending a conference, then this is the app for you.
      We developed this app so participants could share their "viewing schedules" and "reasons for interest" before the event, which they could use as a reference for session selection and to enjoy the conference even more.
      Why do you want to see the session? Share it before the event and let's enjoy RubyKaigi together!
