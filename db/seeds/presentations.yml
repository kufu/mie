  title: 'TypeProf for IDE: Enrich Dev-Experience without Annotations'
  type: keynote
  language: JA
  description: Ruby 3.0 comes bundled with TypeProf, a code analysis tool that doesn't
    require so many type annotations. Its primary goal is to create type signatures
    for existing Ruby programs and help users to apply some external type checkers
    like Steep. Since the release, we have made an effort to adapt TypeProf to an
    integrated development environment (IDE), which allows users to enjoy many features
    supported in an IDE, such as browsing method type signatures inferred on the fly,
    find definition, find references, error checking, etc. We demonstrate TypeProf
    for IDE, and present its roadmap.

  title: Why Ruby's JIT was slow
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  description: |-
    In Ruby 2.6, we started to use a JIT compiler architecture called "MJIT", which uses a C compiler to generate native code. While it achieved Ruby 3x3 in one benchmark, we had struggled to optimize web application workloads like Rails with MJIT. The good news is we recently figured out why.

    In this talk, you will hear how JIT architectures impact various benchmarks differently, and why it matters for *you*. You may or may not benefit from Ruby's JIT, depending on what JIT architecture we'll choose beyond the current MJIT. Let's discuss which direction we'd like to go.

  title: Optimizing Partial Backtraces in Ruby 3
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  description: Backtraces are very useful tools when debugging problems in Ruby programs.
    Unfortunately, backtrace generation is expensive for deep callstacks. In older
    versions of Ruby, this is true even if you only want a partial backtrace, such
    as a single backtrace frame. Thankfully, Ruby 3 has been optimized so that it
    no longer processes unnecessary backtrace frames, which can greatly speed up the
    generation of partial backtraces. Join me for an interesting look a Ruby backtraces,
    how they are generated, how we optimized partial backtraces in Ruby 3, and how
    we fixed bugs in the optimization in 3.0.1.

    RuboCop 1.0 stable version was released last year.

    Well, ​RuboCop v1 provided a background to stable upgrade. On the other hand, RuboCop supports various coding styles and the development is a struggle against false positives and false negatives. So, the improvement must go on.
    This presentation shows behind the scenes of development to make RuboCop and environment surrounding it better. Finally, I will show several ideas for future RuboCop.

  title: The Art of Execution Control for Ruby's Debugger
  type: presentation

  description: |-
    We introduce `debug.gem` ([ruby/debug: Debugging functionality for Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/debug)), the fastest debugger for Ruby and how to make it.

    Existing debuggers have performance penalty to control execution. `debug.gem` uses recently introduced `TracePoint` features to mange execution and there is (almost) no penalties.

    `debug.gem` has more interesting features:

    * Remote debugging
    * IDE (VSCode) Integration
    * Thread/Ractor support
    * and more

    In this presentation, we introduce newly created `debug.gem` and show the tricks to make the *fastest* debugger.

  title: 'Variable Width Allocation: Optimizing Ruby''s Memory Layout'
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  description: |-
    Ruby’s current memory model assumes all objects live in fixed size slots. This means that object data is often stored outside of the Ruby heap, which has implications: an object's data can be scattered across many locations, increasing complexity and causing poor locality resulting in reduced efficiency of CPU caches.

    Join us as we explore how our Variable Width Allocation project will move system heap memory into Ruby heap memory, reducing system heap allocations and giving us finer control of the memory layout to optimize for performance.

  title: 'Parallel testing with Ractors: putting CPUs to work'
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  description: |-
    Parallelizing tests is an opportune way of reducing the total runtime for a test suite. Rails achieves this by forking multiple separate workers that fetch tests from a queue. In Ruby 3, Ractors introduced new mechanisms for executing code in parallel. Can they be leveraged by a test framework? And how would that compare to current parallelization solutions?

    Let’s find the answers to these questions by building a test framework built on Ractors, from scratch. We’ll compare the current solutions for parallelization and what advantages or limitations Ractors bring when used in this context.

    Many Ruby programmers use regular expressions frequently. They are an amazingly powerful tool for many different kinds of text processing. However, if not used carefully, they can also be dangerous: They may not exactly match what their writer thinks they match, and they may execute very slowly on certain inputs.
    This talk will help you understand regular expressions better, so that you can make good use of their amazing power while avoiding their dangerous sides. It will also discuss recent changes to Ruby in the area of regular expressions.

  title: Story of Rucy - How to "compile" a BPF binary from Ruby
  type: presentation

  description: |-
    BPF is a technology used in Linux for packet filtering, tracing or access auditing. BPF has its own VM and set of opcodes.

    If you want to write a program that loads and uses BPF binary, you can write it in any language including Ruby.

    However, to prepare a "BPF binary" itself, you generally need to write a bit weird C, and pass it to clang compiler using `bpf` target.

    Wouldn't it be great if we could make these BPF binaries entirely in Ruby?

    Rucy is intended to allow programmers to write their whole BPF programs in Ruby. I'll discuss how to "compile" BPF binaries from Ruby in this talk.

  title: Demystifying DSLs for better analysis and understanding
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  description: |-
    The ability to create DSLs is one of the biggest strengths of Ruby. They allow us to write easy to use interfaces and reduce the need for boilerplate code. On the flip side, DSLs encapsulate complex logic which makes it hard for developers to understand what's happening under the covers.

    Surfacing DSLs as static artifacts makes working with them much easier. Generating RBI/RBS files that declare the methods which are dynamically created at runtime, allows static analyzers like Sorbet or Steep to work with DSLs. This also allows for better developers tooling and as some kind of "DSL linter".

    TruffleRuby together with Truffle Regex can now execute Ruby Regexps up to 40 times faster than CRuby!
    This is possible by just-in-time compiling Ruby Regexps to machine code by using Truffle Regex, a Truffle language for regular expressions. Truffle Regex uses finite-state machines, a [much faster](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html) alternative to backtracking regexp engines.
    Because of the unique capability of GraalVM to inline across languages, the Ruby code and the Regexp are optimized and compiled together for ultimate performance.
