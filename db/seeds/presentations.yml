  title: Unlocking Potential of Property Based Testing with Ractor
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Ruby's ease in test-writing and its rich ecosystem are widely acclaimed. However, traditional testing methods, relying on developer-created cases, often miss edge-case bugs. This talk introduces a testing method and a tool to generate numerous cases automatically, known as 'property based testing'. It's not only a transformative solution to detect bugs but also a nice use case of Ractor because the tool generates dozens to hundreds of cases that can run in parallel.

    I'll explore how Ractor enables efficient execution of property based testing through parallel processing. This combination promises faster, more comprehensive testing, reducing reliance on developer expertise for bug detection. This talk aims to unlock Ruby's full testing potential by highlighting the not-well-known test method.

  title: Does Ruby Parser dream of highly expressive grammar?
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    The ruby parser grammar file has been subjected to many complicated workarounds due to the limitations by Bison. You've probably thought at least once or twice that if richer DSL support would make grammar files more readable.

    For example, pattern involving multiple repetitions separated by commas, like method call arguments, are quite common. It is only natural to desire a concise way to express them given their frequency. In addition, resolving cases where the added grammar conflicts with the existing one is challenging in ruby, which boasts a flexible grammar. It would be easier to add/change the grammar if there are a solution that could easily resolve this conflict.

    In this talk, cover into the outcomes of incorporating additional functionality to extend the DSL in the parser generator. I believe this extension aims to enhance the maintainability of the grammar, thereby contributing to the future development of ruby's syntax.

  description: |-
    In certain online circles, Ruby has a reputation for """being slow""" (very vigorous air quotes). I don’t think this is true; often applications are slow because they are doing a lot more work than expected or intended. It's easy to write innocent-looking code that is actually using expensive abstractions.

    The Ruby 3 series has seen amazing advances in performance. What if, in addition to these advances, we don't have to run as much code? Have you heard the saying "The fastest code is the code which does not run"?

    This is where a profiler comes in: A profiler lets you see where cpu, time, memory and other resources are being spent, and thus can be used to pinpoint exactly why an application is slow, and what it’s doing.

    In this talk, I explore how Datadog’s `ddtrace` open-source profiler works: what’s needed to build a profiler that can be always on, why use sampling, what sources of data the Ruby VM provides, and how you can investigate your Ruby applications with it.

  description: |-
    With each of the past 3 Ruby releases, YJIT has delivered higher and higher performance. However, we are seeing diminishing returns, because as JIT-compiled code becomes faster, it makes up less and less of the total execution time, which is now becoming dominated by C function calls. As such, it may appear like there is a fundamental limit to Ruby’s performance.

    In the first half of the 20th century, some early airplane designers thought that the speed of sound was a fundamental limit on the speed reachable by airplanes, thus coining the term “sound barrier”. This limit was eventually overcome, as it became understood that airflow behaves differently at supersonic speeds.

    In order to break the Ruby performance barrier, it will be necessary to reduce the dependency on C extensions, and start writing more gems in pure Ruby code. In this talk, I want to look at this problem more in depth, and explore how YJIT can help enable writing pure-Ruby software that delivers high performance levels.

    This is my story on how I started my side project to use CDN edge experimentally as a Rack web server for my personal Sinatra application.

    In this talk, we will explore how it works with a live demo, delve into how I experimentally migrated from my traditional Unicorn/Nginx setup, and discuss what it takes to develop an app in an edge computing environment. We'll also touch on a few practical aspects such as performance and limitations in the last half of the discussion so that you can learn what it's like to build your own Rack app taking advantage of the resilience and scalability of a globally distributed computing platform.

  title: Speeding up Instance Variables with Red-Black Trees
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: The introduction of Object Shapes helped speed up cached instance variable
    reads as well as decreased the machine code required for JIT compilation. But
    what about cache misses?  Is there any way we can speed up instance variable access
    in that case? Ruby 3.3 introduced a red-black tree cache to speed up instance
    variable cache misses. Let’s learn how instance variables are implemented, and
    how the red black tree cache speeds them up!

  title: Using "modern" Ruby to build a better, faster Homebrew
  type: presentation

  description: Homebrew is a popular macOS package manager in the Ruby community and
    is also written in Ruby. When it was first created, it used the (fairly old) Ruby
    supplied by macOS and, until recently, has been tied to this version. Learn in
    this talk how and why Homebrew now ships its own Ruby to all users,  modern Ruby
    tooling we now rely heavily on (e.g. Sorbet, RuboCop, etc.), how Ruby versions
    and our love of ActiveSupport have affected the performance of Homebrew and what
    we have planned in future to make Homebrew better, faster and more Ruby-like.

  title: 'JRuby 10: Ruby 3.3 on the Modern JVM'
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: JRuby is the most widely deploy alternative Ruby in the world. Up through
    JRuby 9.4, we have maintained compatibility with old JVM versions, focusing on
    compatibility and support for legacy platforms. With JRuby 10, we're making a
    huge leap forward, with support for the latest JVM features (native functions
    and memory, true lightweight fibers, fast startup and warmup) and a complete set
    of Ruby 3.3 features (including the fiber scheduler, ractors, IO buffers, the
    prism parser, and more). We're pushing performance beyond anything we've done
    before. And we need your help to make this journey. Come see how JRuby brings
    the best of the modern JVM to Ruby, and how you can get involved.

  title: 'From LALR to IELR: A Lrama''s Next Step'
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    In parse.y, there is a variable that represents the state of the Lexer, based on the idea that the Parser and the Lexer can be separated. However, in reality, the state of Parser and Lexer are shared and cannot be said to be separated. Also, the Lexer state is manually managed, but historical history has clouded the view, and additions and modifications must be done with care.
    With the replacement of the parser generator from Bison to Lrama, the time has come to attack parse.y from the parser generator side, and Lrama is trying to solve this problem by generating an algorithmic parser called PSLR. As a first step, I will show how Lrama can generate a parser for a new algorithm called IELR, which is a prerequisite for PSLR.
    IELR is an improved version of LALR and can parse grammars that LALR cannot. In this presentation, I will explain the implementation of Lrama and how the parser is actually generated.

  title: Ruby and the World Record Pi Calculation
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    I broke the world record of pi calculations with 100 trillion digits. When I was preparing for the challenge, I created a small Ruby script and an ERB template for the calculation software config file to automate benchmarking, and a shell one-liner to create a CSV file for review. The script saved me days of manual work and allowed me to find optimal parameters. The final calculation took 157 days, almost twice as fast as the earliest configurations, which could’ve taken more than 300 days.

    This talk will show you how I turned the vague problem scope (breaking the pi world record) into a smaller solvable task (automation with Ruby). You’ll also learn scripting techniques for benchmarking such as invoking an external program in Ruby, and multiline text formatting with the sed, grep, and paste commands.

    You may not calculate pi, but I’m sure you have a thing or two that you want your computer to do for you!

  title: Finding and fixing memory safety bugs in C with ASAN
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    In order to deliver an experience of programmer happiness to users of Ruby, the developers of CRuby itself (as well as the authors of extension gems) must cut through the dangerous jungle of manual memory management in C. Simple mistakes in the use of pointers, or failing to follow the Ruby garbage collector's rules precisely, can work fine on development machines but cause rare, hard to debug crashes in production environments.

    ASAN (Address SANitizer) is a tool for instrumenting compiled code to catch invalid memory accesses as they happen and crash the program immediately, leading you straight to the buggy code. This is far easier to troubleshoot than crashing at some later point, when the memory corruption has caused some other, totally innocent code to crash!

    In this talk, you'll learn how to enable ASAN in your builds (of both Ruby itself and of extension gems), and how to interpret its output. We'll also cover a little bit about how ASAN works in CRuby.

    The SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System), released in the early 1990s, is known as the Super Famicom in Japan.

    I have worked on porting mruby/c to the SNES and successfully ran mruby/c code on it. In this presentation, along with an overview of the SNES's hardware, I will detail the process of porting mruby/c, and introduce how to develop games for the SNES using mruby/c.

    Moreover, a live demonstration using an actual SNES unit is also planned for this presentation.

  type: presentation

  description: |-
    How often have you heard, “I wish Ruby had X from Y”? Developers tend to desire features they love in one language to be available in another. That’s why, for example, we got pattern matching and shorthand Hashes added to Ruby. What’s next? What will inspire the next Ruby syntax addition? Crystal? Elixir? Zig (have you heard about it)? PHP (why not)?

    Let’s embark on a fantastic journey of exploring syntax features from other languages, such as method overloading or null coalescing assignment, and how to port them to Ruby. But why is it fantastic? I want to turn fantasy into reality and show how we can experiment with Ruby syntax additions without waiting for official releases with experimental features.

  title: Make Your Own Regex Engine!
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Regular expression (regex) is a critical feature in Ruby. However, developers often say, "Regex is complicated and causes bugs.", so they avoid using regex. This seems to be due to their incorrect understanding of how regex matching works. The behavior of regex matching is actually **simple**, and a small regex engine (`kantan-regex`) can be implemented in a program of less than **300 lines**.

    In this talk, I will describe the behavior of regex matching through the implementation of `kantan-regex`.  Furthermore, I will show how, with a few modifications, extensions such as look-around and optimizations such as memoization can be easily implemented. We believe that this talk will help to deepen our understanding of regex implementations and make using regex in everyday life more enjoyable.

    A tutorial on implementing `kantan-regex` is [available](https://makenowjust.github.io/kantan-regex-book/) on Web (Japanese only).

  description: Ruby 3.2 released ruby.wasm, allowing Ruby to run in the browser as
    WebAssembly. Several features were missing for comfortable programming. For example,
    require_relative to load other scripts, the new method to initialize JavaScript
    objects, and some converters between Ruby and JavaScript. I wrote three Ruby programs
    for the browser, found the missing features, and implemented them. I will introduce
    my work on ruby.wasm and talk a bit about features I will add in the future. Those
    who listen to this talk will feel that using Ruby in the browser is wonderful.

    During the last few years, the Ruby community invested significant effort into improving developer tooling. A lot of this effort has been divergent; trying out many solutions to find out what works best and fits Rubyists expectations.

    So where are we at this point? How do we compare to other ecosystems? Is it time to converge, unite efforts and reduce fragmentation? And where are we going next? Let’s analyze the full picture of Ruby developer tooling and try to answer these questions together.
