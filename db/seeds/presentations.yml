  description: |-
    WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary format for programs written in any language, designed to eventually run everywhere without changes, mainly inside Web browsers. Wasm is now used beyond the Web, from edge computing to smart contracts in blockchain.

    Now CRuby can be compiled to WebAssembly, which can be run in web browsers and many non-web environments with WASI.

    This talk will give you how we got there, techniques, and its use cases.

  title: Making *MaNy* threads on Ruby
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    We will introduce *MaNy* project: supports massive number of threads on Ruby.

    Concurrent mchanism (threads, processes, etc.) is an important language feature especially for multiple network connections.
    Ruby supports Ractor/Thread/Fiber for concurrency. However making many Threads (and Ractors) introduce huge overhead. Fiber scheduler was introduced for this purpose but it has some limitations.

    On the other languages, for example, Go language supports goroutine. They can make many goroutines and they can run concurrently or in parallel. Other languages (Erlang, Rust, ...) also support similar features.

    They use a well-known technique called M:N threading. In short, M:N threading supports many M threads on N (enough small number) system threads. *MaNy* project introduces M:N threading into Ruby.

    In this talk, we will show the background and progress of *MaNy* project. Because we are replacing the threading mechanism of current Ruby, we can share some details about it.

  title: Building a Lightweight IR and Backend for YJIT
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Last year, the YJIT compiler was upstreamed into CRuby and released as part of Ruby 3.1. Key advantages of YJIT are that it delivers fast warm up time and significant speedup on typical Ruby workloads such as Rails applications. However, up to this point, YJIT has only been available on x86-64 platforms.

    This year, our goal is to transition from an experimental compiler towards something more broadly usable and future-proof. In order to make YJIT available on more platforms, we are currently working on the implementation of a new Intermediate Representation (IR) and backend for the compiler. This will make it possible for YJIT to run natively on the Apple M1/M2, AWS Graviton processors and the Raspberry Pi.

    This talk will cover our objectives and constraints, the design of our new IR, the strategy we took to be able to support both x86-64 and ARM CPUs, the challenges we encountered, how we plan to optimize the quality of the generated machine code, and early performance results.

    ruby/debug is one of the very active projects, and many users use it. Also, there are some hidden valuable features to enhance your development experience. This talk dives into Chrome integration and History Viewer within them.

    Chrome integration:

    History Viewer:
    What do you do when you want to step back to the specified line?
    History Viewer can help you in the situation. History Viewer, which extends stepping back, is the feature in VSCode extension for ruby/debug. You can go back to the location without thinking about how many times "step back" commands are needed.

    In this talk, I will introduce how to use them and how they work, such as how to communicate between ruby/debug and Chrome DevTools.

  type: presentation

  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    An object cache is like magic: put an object into the box and it comes back later, exactly as it went in. The magic is seductive because it makes things so easy.

    It only takes a bit of thought, however, to see the dangers of this trick. Class names can change; a method can return a different result. Objects exist in a universe, and that universe is constantly evolving.

    Marshal, Ruby's default binary serialization library, does not handle changes like this gracefully. We discovered this recently when a code change collided with a cached class, leading to a fire in production.

    To avoid incidents like this, we switched the cache serializer in our core Rails monolith from Marshal to MessagePack, an alternative, generic binary serializer. MessagePack has a more compact format than Marshal, with stricter typing and less magic.

    In this talk, I'll crack open MessagePack to show how it works, how we migrated to it, and why you might want to do the same.

    $ ruby test.rb

    ```

    We will talk about the design and implementation of error_highlight: how it works, why and how we designed it, how we resolved the difficulties we faced during implementation, and the feedback we received.

    This feature goes further in Ruby 3.2: more error support other than `NameError`/`NoMethodError` and more fine-grained error spotting.
    We also redesigned its backend by introducing a new API, `Exception#detailed_message`, which allows us to enhance error messages with fewer incompatibilities. In fact, it allowed simple integration with other error message extensions such as did_you_mean and dead_end.

    We will also talk about what we would like users to help us with to make error_highlight better.

    By writing code generation scripts using this framework, you can automate RBS generation as much as possible in accordance with Ruby code updates.
    You can use the Rack architecture to combine your preferred features to meet a variety of needs.
    In addition, you can test your own extensions on the fly or publish them as extension gems.

To make them happier, experts would be able to set up config perfectly. But again, it is not very easy in reality. As a result, even though there is no evil, in some case people wrongfully make detour and give up their creativeness to keep CI green. It's a pity, isn't it?

    YJIT is CRuby's second just-in-time compiler first released with Ruby 3.1.0.
    Much sweat and tears were shed during YJIT's development. What are the performance
    goals of YJIT and how are we going for them? How do CPUs react to YJIT's output?
    What is it like to retrofit a JIT compiler into a runtime system with a long history?
    Why is Rust involved now?
