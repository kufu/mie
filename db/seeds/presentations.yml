  title: The future vision of Ruby Parser
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Recently maintainability and usability of ruby's parser have been discussed. There are several approaches for these problems, however I believe LR parser is the best solution for supporting Ruby's elegant syntax.

    When using parser generators, we write a grammar description file like "parse.y". In a grammar file, many DSL, e.g. %parse-param, %initial-action, %left, %right ..., are used to control the behavior of generated parser. Even so Push Down Automaton has potential to solve these problems, parser generator's DSL is not enough to represent it. Such impedance mismatches between DSL and PDA requires us to use hacks like lex state.

    This talk will cover redesigning the responsibility of lexer and parser, how to expand DSL for grammar files and introduction to Lrama parser generator.

  title: Generating type signatures for dynamic mixins with Tapioca
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Last year, Tapioca became the official tool for generating RBI type signatures in the Sorbet ecosystem. Using Tapioca, developers can quickly generate accurate type signatures for external Ruby gems, allowing them to use Sorbet in their projects even if most gems have not yet added type signatures.

    In this talk, I’ll explain how I implemented new functionality in Tapioca to help it generate type signatures for dynamic mixins in Ruby gems. Along the way, we’ll learn about how Tapioca uses information about the Ruby object model to generate type signatures, and how this work has impacted the Ruby language as a whole.

  title: Make Regexp#match much faster
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Regular expressions (Regexp) are the fundamental text-processing tool for programmers. Ruby also has Regexp functions as the standard feature.
    Regexp is helpful, but it may cause some problems. The typical issue is ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service), a vulnerability in Regexp matching. When Regexp matching is implemented by back-tracking, a matching time could explode. This explosion overloads a service and makes it hard to provide the service. Such a DoS attack using Regexp matching is called ReDoS. For example, it caused [damage to Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/).
    Previous Ruby's Regexp implementation could cause ReDoS. In Ruby 3.2.0, Regexp matching has been optimized to prevent ReDoS. This optimization makes Regexp, which previously took exponential matching time, be matched in linear time.
    In this talk, I will describe a Regexp matching implementation and the details of the Regexp matching optimization implemented in Ruby 3.2.0.

  title: Understanding the Ruby Global VM Lock by observing it
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    The Global VM Lock (GVL), also known as Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), is an implementation detail of the CRuby VM.
    At a high-level, it prevents Ruby code across multiple threads from running in parallel (while still allowing concurrency!).

    The GVL is an extremely important implementation detail, as it can have a big impact on the performance and responsiveness of any Ruby application that uses more than a single thread to do its work.

    In this talk, I explore what the GVL is, why it is no longer called global VM lock, its impact on Ruby applications and how we can see it in action by using the GVL instrumentation API through the `gvl-tracing` and `gvltools` gems.

  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Dynamic memory management is a complex and often controversial topic. There
    are a wide variety of different algorithms and approaches that one can take
    towards managing memory, both manually and automatically.

    Some language implementations tend to pick their favourite approach early in
    their development, like Pythons reference counting and Ruby's extended Mark
    Sweep collector, and stick with it for the long term.

    Others, like the JVM, aim to have a more configurable approach, with multiple
    Garbage Collection algorithms that can be configured at runtime, or even
    dynamically tuned by the VM during program execution.

    What if we could have that for Ruby?

    This talk is going to be an exploration of how we can support multiple GC
    algorithms in Ruby. We'll talk about building a unified memory management API,
    and explore our integration with MMTk, a research project to build a unified
    memory management toolkit, with integrations into the JVM, v8, Julia, and now

    A bit over a year ago, the Trojan Source attacks (https://trojansource.codes) created quite a bit of a scare. This talk looks at what has already been done, and what can and should be done, for Ruby.

    Ruby has embraced Unicode in the form of UTF-8 for source code so that identifiers as well as comments can use non-ASCII characters. This can be very convenient but also may be dangerous.

    We will explain the dangers: Bidirectional attacks can use special Unicode formatting characters to regroup source text so that it looks like it does something, but actually does something else. Homoglyph attacks can use lookalike characters to confuse code reviewers. Invisible characters and special spaces can be even more difficult to detect.

    Remedies include better Ruby parsing, new checks to editors, IDEs, and code management sites such as github, and stronger linters such as Rubycop. We will discuss what has already been done, what still needs to be done, and how to use the various tools together.

  type: presentation

  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    The fact that there is no increment/decrement operator in Ruby is known to many Rubyists. Currently, if you try to write code like `i = 0; i++` in Ruby, MRI's parser considers it syntactically invalid.

    Still if we want them, that means adding a new syntax for `++` operator to Ruby. This seems like a simple syntax at first glance, but to achieve this we need to dig a little deeper into MRI, explore parse.y - the parser file called "魔窟" (the maze), and consider the compatibility with existing specifications of Ruby.

    This talk will show you some ideas to obtain `++` with the trial-and-error process of a programmer who is not an expert of parser, thereby making the interesting topics, lexical analysis and parsing more familiar to you.

    Blocks are one of the most expressive parts of the Ruby syntax. Many Ruby methods take a block. When a method is given different blocks, there is a crucial optimization necessary to unlock the best performance.
    This optimization dates back to the early days of research on dynamic languages, yet it seems only a single Ruby implementation currently uses it.
    This optimization is called splitting and what it does is using different copies of a method and specialize them to the block given at different call sites. This enables compiling the method and the block together for the best performance.

  description: |-
    Are your tests running fast enough?
    As far as I know, the most effective solution is test parallelization if your project testing is slow.

    In recent years, parallel testing has been included in Rails 6 for parallelization of tests, but speeding up tests is important not only for Rails. parallel_tests and test-queue are well-known parallel test runners for vanilla Ruby, classic Rails application project, and so on.

    Both parallel_tests and test-queue support testing in parallel, and each has a different strategy. The test-queue strategy has distinct advantages over parallel_tests but maintenance was stuck when I got a commit bit for test-queue. So I've been contributing to the resurrection of the product sustainability. I will share some lesser-known parallel testing insights I've gained in reviving the test-queue. And explore possibilities of parallel programming in Ruby.

    I hope this talk makes an opportunity to make your test faster and makes you happy.

    Sharing code in Ruby is like sharing stuff on the web: grab a top-level name that's free, park your stuff under it, and point to the address. Like the Internet, Ruby's constant namespace is global and reachable from anywhere.

    But although it feels natural, there are serious downsides to this approach. Working in a single, shared universe makes namespace pollution a necessary fact of life; boundaries and code isolation depend on the good manners of every maintainer in your Gemfile.

    In this talk, I present a gem called Im that lets you share your code without touching the global namespace at all. A fork of Zeitwerk, Im leverages new features in Ruby 3.2 to load constants onto namespaces whose roots are anonymous.

    Loading this way positions each unit of code at the center of its own universe, free from name conflicts and isolated from the rest of the world. We explore how this freedom impacts the writing and sharing of code, and the benefits it unlocks for designing applications at scale.

    Just evaluating inefficient regular expressions may break your service - one with an exponential time complexity may cause a denial-of-service (ReDoS), depending on engines.

    Ruby had adopted a native algorithm like some of the major languages, leaving a risk of ReDoS. However, Ruby 3.2 introduced drastic updates to the Regexp engine internals to reduce the risk. Ruby developers no longer need to be afraid of it for basic usage.

    To confirm the effectiveness of the language-level changes in addressing ReDoS, this talk will provide a case study by highlighting real ReDoS vulnerabilities in GitLab.

    ADBC is Apache Arrow Database Connectivity. It provides a API that can connect to different databases by wrapping database specific APIs.

    This is not a new approach. There are existing APIs such as Active Record, Sequel and ODBC. The difference between the existing APIs and ADBC is the focus on large data and performance.

    ADBC is an important part to use Ruby for data processing. We can extract large data from many databases (not only RDBMSs but also data ware houses and so on) and load large data into many databases with ADBC. To use Ruby for data processing, we need data. ADBC helps it.

  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: In this talk, we'll cover how Rubyfmt was built. This will include
    a breakdown of the technical details of how the Rubyfmt binary is built, embedding
    Ruby in Rust, calling Ruby from Rust, and how we built the data structures for
    the parse tree, as well as how we ended up building the formatting system itself.
    You should attend this talk if you are already fluent in Ruby and want to learn
    how underlying C of Ruby's parser works, and how you can call it from Rust.

  title: Find and Replace Code based on AST
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    When we want to find and replace code, we usually search by plain text or regular expression, it's quick for simple cases, but I'd like to share with you how to do a much more powerful and accurate find and replace based on AST.

    I have built [synvert](https://synvert.net/) for years, it allows you to write snippet code to rewrite ruby code, it provides CLI, GUI, and VSCode extension, and it can automatically generate snippets, so even junior developers can rewrite code based on AST at will.

    You'll learn how to use rex and racc to define a css-like node query language, and how to mutate code based on AST node. You'll also learn how to use synvert GUI to rewrite your code even if you don't have any idea about AST.

  description: The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) underpins the vast majority
    of Ruby web applications, but its details are often hidden from the application
    layer. In this session, we will explore the inner workings of the HTTP protocol,
    its evolution from HTTP/0.9 to HTTP/3, and the various interfaces and implementations
    offered for HTTP clients and servers for the Ruby programming language. Additionally,
    we will delve into the world of Asynchronous HTTP, examining its key concepts
    and benefits, and learn how to leverage its power within Ruby to build fast, scalable,
    and efficient web applications. From understanding the history of HTTP, to implementing
    best practices for Asynchronous HTTP, this presentation is a starting point for
    anyone looking to improve their Ruby web development skills. Unleash the power
    of Asynchronous HTTP with Ruby.

  title: Rethinking Strings
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Ruby strings serve two distinct purposes: the representation of textual data and the representation of binary data. These two use cases generally require different operations, but today they're both accessible via `String`. Combining the two creates a discoverability issue and can be error-prone.  Many `String` operations have no logical meaning for arbitrary binary data. Having to use strings with a special encoding to pass binary data around is a non-obvious solution and hampers Ruby's usability. Moreover, binary data can sometimes look like ASCII text, which may help build false trust in code with logic errors. Such errors are nuanced and difficult to debug.

    This talk takes a high-level look at Ruby's strings and encodings, highlighting potentially problematic areas and suggesting ways to improve. While the emphasis is on the logical interface for text and binary data, we'll also look at the performance ramifications of the current design and how that might improve as well.
